Our system is designed to recognize symbols from user-input images by employing a sophisticated algorithm for identification. The process involves several intricate image processing steps to ensure accurate symbol recognition. 

Initially, the RGB image is converted to grayscale, a crucial step for subsequent processing stages. Subsequently, the grayscale image is further transformed into a binary image to enhance recognition accuracy. Additional preprocessing steps are implemented to eliminate unwanted artifacts and environmental noise, ensuring the clarity of the symbol image.

Symbol templates are stored in a dedicated directory, each template image standardized to a fixed size to simplify the recognition process. These template images are also converted to grayscale and constitute the dataset used by the system.

When a user submits a query image, it undergoes resizing and is compared with the template images in the dataset. The comparison is conducted based on pixel values, and the result is presented in a text format, indicating the recognized symbol. The system's core functionality revolves around template matching, which enables it to achieve an impressive accuracy rate ranging from 80% to 90%.
